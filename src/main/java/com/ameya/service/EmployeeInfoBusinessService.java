To address SQL injection vulnerabilities in Java, it's important to use prepared statements with parameterized queries instead of concatenating user input directly into SQL statements. This approach ensures that user input is treated as data, not executable code, thereby preventing SQL injection attacks.

Below is a revised version of a Java file that addresses potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by using `PreparedStatement`:

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class SecureDatabaseAccess {

    private static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/yourdatabase";
    private static final String DB_USER = "yourusername";
    private static final String DB_PASSWORD = "yourpassword";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String userInput = "exampleUser"; // This should be obtained from a secure source, e.g., user input
        getUserData(userInput);
    }

    public static void getUserData(String username) {
        String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?";

        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD);
             PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(query)) {

            // Set the value for the placeholder
            preparedStatement.setString(1, username);

            try (ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery()) {
                while (resultSet.next()) {
                    // Process the result set
                    String user = resultSet.getString("username");
                    String email = resultSet.getString("email");
                    System.out.println("User: " + user + ", Email: " + email);
                }
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Changes and Security Improvements:

1. **Use of `PreparedStatement`:** The code uses `PreparedStatement` to safely include user input in SQL queries. The `?` placeholder is used in the SQL statement, and the actual value is set using `preparedStatement.setString(1, username)`. This prevents SQL injection by ensuring that the input is treated as a parameter, not executable SQL.

2. **Resource Management:** The code uses try-with-resources to automatically close `Connection`, `PreparedStatement`, and `ResultSet` objects, which is a best practice to prevent resource leaks.

3. **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is included with `SQLException` to catch and print any SQL-related errors.

4. **Secure Input Handling:** Although not shown in this example, always validate and sanitize user input where applicable before processing it further.

By following these practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities in your Java applications.
